Before we jump into the technicals of Data Science, let us understand the different aspects of [Data](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-data-8f94ae3a56b4) - 9 mins

Next topic we want you to look into is the Mathematics in Data Science. Maths & Stats is the heart of Data Science. Learn the fundamentals of essential Maths & Stats before diving deep.

Every data has some story to tell. We use different kinds of plots to visualize the hidden pattern/insights in the data. Understand the different kinds of plots and what insights they give.
